Box2DANE
========

Box2D AIR Native Extension

The Box2DANEC folder should be in your src directory of your project in Eclipse. Also, Box2D
itself should be within your src folder. 

For the Actionscript side of things, the project is a Flashdevelop project. So you'll need this
if you want to conveniently work with the AS side.
